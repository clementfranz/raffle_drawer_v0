          The Developer initially agreed to develop the{" "}
          <b> "Kopiko Blanca National Raffle Draw System" ("System") </b> for a
          fee of <b>PHP 2,500</b>, considering the Licensee as a valued
          acquaintance.

        <h2>1.2 Scope Realization:</h2>
        <p>
          Upon further development, it was recognized that the System's
          complexity and visual requirements exceeded initial expectations.
          Consequently, the Developer determined that an annual licensing model
          would be more appropriate to reflect the System's value and ongoing
          maintenance needs.
