        <h2>24.1 Invalidation of Previous Drafts</h2>
        <p>
          All previous iterations, drafts, or informal versions of this License
          Agreement — whether oral, written, printed, or digital — are hereby
          rendered null, void, and non-binding. Only the final, signed, and
          dated version of this License Agreement, identified by its unique
          Document ID and official repository URL, shall be deemed legally valid
          and enforceable between the Licensor and the Licensee.
        </p>

        <h2>24.2 Deletion of Superseded Drafts</h2>
        <p>
          The Licensee agrees to permanently delete all prior draft versions or
          unofficial copies of this License Agreement from their systems,
          devices, cloud accounts, backups, and any other forms of storage, to
          avoid misrepresentation, confusion, or abuse. Retention or use of such
          outdated drafts for operational, reference, or fallback purposes is
          expressly prohibited.
        </p>

        <h2>24.3 Version Control and Supersession</h2>
        <p>
          Any future amendments or updated versions of this License Agreement
          shall include a distinct version number and effective date, clearly
          indicated in the document header and metadata. All prior official
          versions will be archived solely by the Licensor for historical or
          audit purposes, but shall be considered legally superseded upon
          release of the new version.
        </p>

        <h2>24.4 Prohibited Use of Expired or Superseded Versions</h2>
        <p>
          Any attempt by the Licensee or its affiliates to retain, restore, or
          activate past versions of the Licensed Software or associated
          documentation — including but not limited to circumventing license
          expiry warnings, restoring deprecated UI features, or bypassing usage
          restrictions — shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.
          Such action may result in immediate license termination, legal action,
          and the imposition of applicable damages, penalties, or injunctions
          under prevailing law.
